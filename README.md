### Technical info

* The MyBinder image is build using Docker
* The notebook dependences are in requirements.txt 
* This notebook works only with notebook==5.4.1. With newer versions the potree visualization fails to load 

### Updates

* 01/08/2022: Binder image is currently not working, probably an issue with the interaction of jupyter and the requirements. More recent requirements are: 
   `numpy matplotlib scipy geojson pyproj==2.4.1 opencv-contrib-python==4.5.3.56 ad rasterio srtm4 folium rpcm numba pypotree` and they work correctly in colab.
